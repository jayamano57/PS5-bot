# Jay's PS5 Bot ðŸ¤–

First and foremost, this project was for educational purposes only! I did not, and will not ever use this project to cheat normal buyers from potentially getting their hands on a PS5. I want to make that process as fair as possible. All the data I used to test this project were fake data. 
The purpose of this project was to challenge myself in creating a popular type of bot -- a PS5 bot... and I believe I have accomplished just that.
